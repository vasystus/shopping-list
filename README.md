 ## ✍️My To-do list to create a To-do(well, Shopping) List

1. Read carefully user stories;
2. Create a HTML skeleton;
3. Work on Javascript functions and tests;
4. CSS magic;
5. Fix bugs/check tests once again;
7. Check accessibility with the Lighthouse;
8. Deploy;
9. Enjoy the pizza:

## 🏹User stories:

✅Add tasks to a list so that I can keep track of them;

✔️Check things off my list so that I can see what I’ve done;

❎Delete things from the list if I don’t need to do them anymore;

---

## 🏆Acceptance Criteria

* A working to-do list;
* Tests for (at least) each user story;
* A responsive, mobile-first design;
* Ensure your app is accessible to as many different users as possible;
